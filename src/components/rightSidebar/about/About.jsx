        I've been playing around with programming for over a decade now. It
        started with basics like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then expanded into
        more complex territories like React and Node.js. I also got into mobile
        app development, which is a different beast but so much fun. I did a
        bootcamp somewhere along the way, first of all because I wanted to
        structure what I knew.

        I love connecting with people, especially those who are passionate about
        what they do. Whether it's about tech, a new hobby, or just a random
        chat, I'm up for it!

        Away from the screen, life's good. I spend quality time with my wife and
        daughterâ€”my two pillars of support. Oh, and we have the fluffiest cat
        you'd ever see.
